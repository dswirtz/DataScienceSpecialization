## NextWord Application & Presentation - The Capstone Project

#### Background
This is the Capstone Project for the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The objective of this project is to develop an algorithm that predicts the next word in a phrase. From there, the algorithm is developed into a Shiny web application then pitched via R Studio Presenter slide deck. 

When developing the Shiny application and slide deck, the following were taken into consideration:

Data Product

- Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?
- Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?
- When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?
- Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?

Slide Deck

- Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?
- Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?
- Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?
- How would you describe the experience of using this app?
- Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?
- Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?

#### Data
The [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip) consists of a corpus of blog, news, and twitter entries provided by the Johns Hopkins University. The [milestone report](http://rpubs.com/dswirtz/milestone) has some exploratory details on the dataset. A random 5% sample from each document was taken and merged into new dataset then used to develop the prediction algorithm. A markdown of the data processing and algorithm is included with this application.
