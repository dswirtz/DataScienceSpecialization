# Developing Data Products

This is course project for Developing Data Products in the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. This project is broken down into two parts:

1. Build a web application using the `shiny` package in Rstudio and deploy it on its servers
2. Make a presentation using either `slidify` or `Rstudio Presenter` to make a pitch about the application

The guidelines for building the application are as follows:

1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
5. The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

The guidelines for the presentation are as follows:

1. It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
2. It must be 5 pages
3. It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
4. It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

The data used for this project is a modified [statcrunch](http://www.statcrunch.com) version found in this repository.
