# RegressionModels

This data anaylsis was performed to specifications required by the course project of the Regression Models course in the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. In this project, the R dataset, mtcars, was used to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (mpg).

The data was used to answer the following questions:

* Is automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?

* What is the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?

Based on this regression analysis, we can conclude that manual transmission cars have a higher miles per gallon (mpg). After ajusting the miles per gallon for horsepower (hp), number of cylinders (cyl), and weight (wt), manual transmission cars get 1.8 more miles per gallon when comparing the automatic transmission cars. To further the analysis, we can conclude that MPGs will decrease by 2.5 for every 1000-pound increase in weight. MPGs will decrease 0.32 for every 10 increase in horsepower. When the number of cylinders increase from 4 to 6, the MPGs decrease by 3. And finally, the MPGs will decrease by another 2.2 when the numbers of cylinders is increased from 6 to 8.
