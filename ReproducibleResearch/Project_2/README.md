# ReproducibleResearch_2

This data anaylsis was performed to specifications required by the course project of the Reproducible Research course in the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. This project looks at the severe weather impact on the public health and economy in the US.

##Synopsis

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

Upon completion of the analysis, I have determined that tornadoes have the greatest impact when it comes to population health and floods have the greatest impact when it comes to economic consequences.

##Data

The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. You can download the file from the course web site:

* Dataset: [Storm Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) [47Mb]

There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

* National Climatic Data Center Storms Events [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

##Questions

The step-by-step analysis below addresses the following questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the **EVTYPE** variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
