Part I investigates the exponential distribution in R and compares it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. I investigated the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that a thousand simulations have taken place.

Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. You should:

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

Part II investigates the effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs. The response is the length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid). For this exploratory analysis, we are interested in how the tooth growth compares based on delivery method and dosage.
